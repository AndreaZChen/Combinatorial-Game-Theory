# Combinatorial-Game-Theory

This script defines a new Python class, "Game", that corresponds to a combinatorial game in the sense of Conway (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory if you are not familiar). Note that this script does NOT yet contain all the appropriate notation for games; for example, it will not recognize dyadic rationals and print them as numbers (although it will still perform calculations on them correctly).
